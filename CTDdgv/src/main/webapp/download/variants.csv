All patients will receive osimertinib at the dose of 80 mg/d. Tumor assessment according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) 1.1 criteria will be performed every 3 months, with brain and thoracoabdominal computed tomographic scan. The continuation of osimertinib is at the discretion of the referring physician, particularly if clinical benefit is observed. The primary objective is the genetic tumor profile, both on tissue biopsy and ctDNA analyses, at the time of disease progression. Other endpoints include kinetic studies of ctDNA, biological progression-free survival (bPFS) (time from first study dose to first biological event on ctDNA), median PFS according to RECIST criteria 1.1 (called radiological [r] PFS), and median clinical (c) PFS (time from the first study dose to off-osimertinib).",_,osimertinib,_,_,_,_,_,_

Screening for KRAS and NRAS mutations was performed using approved in vitro diagnostic tests. KRAS and NRAS were required to be WT within exon 2 codons 12 and 13, exon 3 codons 59 and 61, and exon 4 codons 117 and 146.

KIT/PDGFRA ctDNA mutation profiling of plasma samples at baseline and end of treatment was assessed with 74-gene Guardant360 CDx. Molecular subgroups were determined and correlated with outcomes.,_,_,enriched upon disease progression with avapritinib treatment.,_,_,_,_,_
